# Ultralight Airplane Design, Simulation, and Assembly

### AerobotiX INSAT Club

**Technologies:** AutoCAD, PredimRC, XFOIL, Aerodynamics

## Introduction

This project, conducted by a team of 4 members at AerobotiX INSAT Club, focuses on the design, simulation, and assembly of an ultralight glider aircraft. Our goal was to create an efficient and structurally sound aircraft for recreational flying.

## Project Scope

Commencing from August 12, 2022, to August 25, 2022, this project involved meticulous design, simulation, and assembly phases. Our 4-member team dedicated efforts to optimize every aspect of the aircraft, ensuring both performance and safety.

## Technical Details

- **Efficient Wing Design**: Developed a wing with a fixed 1m wingspan and a 20cm chord, achieving an optimal aspect ratio and wing area for enhanced aerodynamic performance.
- **Stabilizer Engineering**: Engineered a stable stabilizer design with optimized surface area and dimensions, ensuring flight stability and control.
- **Precise Aerodynamic Analysis**: Utilized PredimRC and XFOIL software for comprehensive aerodynamic analysis, selecting optimal airfoil options for increased lift and reduced drag.
- **Structural Optimization**: Fine-tuned aircraft dimensions and weight distribution to ensure stability and compliance with safety regulations.
